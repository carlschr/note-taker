# Note Taker Project

## About the Project
The goal of this project was to create the back-end for a notetaking application using express. The front-end for this project was provided. All data for the saved notes is stored in a json file; and, as the data gets updated, the js file reads and writes over the file with the updated json. This project required these node modules: 'fs', 'path', 'express'.
